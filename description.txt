[h2]PD Habitats Additions[/h2]
[list]
[*] Allows the planetary habitats to be upgraded to Habitat Arcologies using the "Arcology Project" ascension perk instead of the "Sidereal Arcologies".
[*] If the Planetary Arcology Habitat is fully encased in arcology districts, you can upgrade the planetary habitat finally to an Ecumenopolis using a decision. After all the planet is fully covered in domes and infrastructure, might as well go to the next level!
[*] Planetary habitats now get automatically colonized if void dwellers.
[*] Planetary Arcology Habitats now sport new textures created by Borsk, showing your progress in ecumenopolizing the habitat.
