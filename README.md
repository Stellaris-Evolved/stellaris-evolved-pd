# Stellaris Evolved - Planetary Diversity patch

## Changes and Additions

### General Changes

- Support all around for Evolved civics, ethics, traditions and mechanics for districts, buildings and jobs where possible.


### PD More Arcologies Additions

- Use PD planet entities for some of the Evolved ecumenopolis specializations.
- Allow capital arcologies on elysiums and arcology habitats.


### PD Habitats Additions

- Allows the planetary habitats to be upgraded to Habitat Arcologies using the "Arcology Project" ascension perk instead of the "Sidereal Arcologies".
- If the Planetary Arcology Habitat is fully encased in arcology districts, you can upgrade the planetary habitat finally to an Ecumenopolis using a decision. After all the planet is fully covered in domes and infrastructure, might as well go to the next level!
- Planetary habitats now get automatically colonized if void dwellers.
- Planetary Arcology Habitats now sport new textures created by Borsk, showing your progress in ecumenopolizing the habitat.
